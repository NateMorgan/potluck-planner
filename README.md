# Potluck Planner

## [Potluck Planner](TBD) 

## Background & Description
🥘 Welcome to **Potluck Planner**! 🥘<br /> 
Here to help host your next potluck party!

This side project was inspired by and built for my sister/friend, Rina, who enjoys hosting potluck parties in her home and was interested in using another planning tool outside of Google spreadsheets. I thought this would be a good opportunity for me to build another full-stack application using the MERN stack and become more familiar with using React.
